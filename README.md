Have you ever heard someone say something funny or interesting that made you wish your recorder was on? Stay one step ahead with Retroactive Recorder.
Retroactive Recorder is an audio recording app the constantly saves the past 1 to 30 minutes of audio that your phone hears. At any time you can press the "save" button to save some or all of the past half hour of sound to a WAV file for later playback. 

The free version of the app saves up to five minutes, buy the pro version for up to 30 minutes.

Step One:
Download and activate the app.
Step Two:
Forget about it. The app will constantly record your surrounds and doesn't need your attention to stay functional. It will even start back up after you reboot up your phone.
Step Three:
Hear someone say something interesting and wait for them to finish.
Step Four:
Press the save button to keep the past few minutes of audio data.

This repo is missing the core mechanics behind how recording works. I decided to keep it private.
